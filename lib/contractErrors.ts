/**
 * Soroban contract error codes and their user-friendly messages.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for mapping contract error codes to messages.
 * Error codes are shared across the four RWA contracts (registry, asset-token,
 * compliance, dividend), so messages are written to be context-agnostic.
 *
 * Reference: https://github.com/RWA-ToolKit/stellar-rwa-contracts/blob/main/contracts/asset-token/src/error.rs
 *
 * When adding new codes:
 * - Add the code-to-message mapping below with documentation
 * - Update the contracts repo error enum
 * - Add test coverage in lib/__tests__/contractErrors.test.ts
