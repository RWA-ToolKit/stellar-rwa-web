# Custom and Local RPC Setup

By default, the app connects to the public Stellar Soroban RPC endpoints. For development or testing against a local or custom RPC instance, you can override these endpoints via environment variables.

## Quick Start: Local Soroban Network

To run the app against a **local Soroban quickstart** (standalone network):

1. **Start your local Soroban network:**
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it \
     -p 8000:8000 \
     stellar/quickstart:latest \
     --standalone
   ```
   This exposes a local Soroban RPC at `http://localhost:8000`.

2. **Set the environment variable in `.env.local`:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8000
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_NETWORK=testnet
   ```

3. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app now talks to your local network. Since the local network has no deployed contracts, you'll need to deploy the registry, compliance, and dividend contracts there first, then set their IDs:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_REGISTRY_ID=<local-registry-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_COMPLIANCE_ID=<local-compliance-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_DIVIDEND_ID=<local-dividend-id>
```

## Custom Remote RPC Provider

To point the app at a different RPC provider (e.g., a private or alternative public endpoint):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://your-custom-rpc.example.com
```

## Failover / Multiple RPC URLs

The app supports RPC failover: if the primary RPC URL fails **three consecutive times**, the app automatically switches to the next URL in the fallback list.

To configure multiple RPC URLs for redundancy:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://primary-rpc.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_RPC_URLS_FALLBACK=https://fallback-1.example.com,https://fallback-2.example.com
```

The app tries URLs in order:
1. **Primary:** `https://primary-rpc.example.com`
2. **Fallback 1:** `https://fallback-1.example.com` (after 3 failures against primary)
3. **Fallback 2:** `https://fallback-2.example.com` (after 3 failures against fallback 1)
4. **Public default:** `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` (always available as a last resort)

### How Failover Works

- Each RPC error increments a failure counter for the current URL.
- After **3 consecutive failures**, the cached RPC client is invalidated and rebuilt against the next URL in the list, with the failure counter reset.
- If only one URL is configured (or all URLs are exhausted), the failure counter still increments but no failover occurs—errors bubble up to the UI.
- The counter is **per network** (Testnet and Mainnet track failures independently) and **per browser session** (resets on page reload).

### Example: High-Availability Setup

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://rpc-1.myinfra.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_RPC_URLS_FALLBACK=https://rpc-2.myinfra.com,https://rpc-3.myinfra.com,https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://mainnet-rpc-1.myinfra.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINNET_RPC_URLS_FALLBACK=https://mainnet-rpc-2.myinfra.com,https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com
```

## Mixed HTTP/HTTPS

The app allows unencrypted HTTP URLs **only** for localhost or testing (useful for local Docker networks). Public URLs must be HTTPS.

```
# Allowed (local testing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Rejected (insecure public URL)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=http://example.com  <- This will fail
```

## Troubleshooting

### "ECONNREFUSED" or "No route to host"

- Verify the RPC URL is reachable: `curl -s https://your-rpc.example.com/health`
- Check firewall rules and DNS resolution.

### High latency on list views

- Check if `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set and responsive. If missing or slow, list operations fall back to simulating every read against RPC, which is much slower.

### "The contract call could not be completed"

- This usually means the RPC is reachable but the contract ID doesn't exist there. Verify you've set the correct contract IDs for this network and that they're actually deployed.
